It sounds like you might be engaging in \"labeling\", a cognitive distortion where we assign labels to ourselves or others based on one incident. Just remember, someone's opinion doesn't define your worth or beauty. Try to challenge this thought by considering the qualities and attributes that make you unique and valuable. As a practical step, consider sharing your feelings with your friend and discuss the impact of their words on you.",

One practical step would be to call ahead, let them know you might be late due to traffic, and use this time in traffic to listen to some calming music or a favorite podcast.",
