While it's completely normal and healthy to grieve, remember that sadness associated with a specific event doesn't mean everything in life is sad or will be forever. Maybe try writing down some positive things in your life to help shift the focus from this loss.",

A helpful step could be talking with your friend about how their comment made you feel, or surrounding yourself with positive affirmations about your self-worth and beauty.",
