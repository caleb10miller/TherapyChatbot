In cognitive behavioral therapy, we work on challenging and changing unhelpful cognitive distortions and behaviors, improving emotional regulation, and developing personal coping strategies that target solving current problems. 

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge your feelings and to understand that it's okay to feel this way. You're not alone. Many people struggle with self-criticism. It's a common issue.

Here are some strategies you might find helpful:

1. Practice self-compassion: Treat yourself with the same kindness, concern, and support you'd show to a good friend. 

2. Challenge your inner critic: When you notice self-critical thoughts, ask yourself if they are really true, and if there's another, more positive way to view the situation. 

3. Practice mindfulness: When you're feeling self-critical, try to bring your attention to the present moment. This can help you break the cycle of habitual, negative thought patterns.

4. Set realistic expectations: It's great to have high standards, but if they're too high, you're setting yourself up for failure. Try to set goals that are challenging, but still achievable.

5. Seek professional help: If self-criticism is causing significant distress, or if you're struggling to manage it on your own, it might be helpful to seek support from a mental health professional.
